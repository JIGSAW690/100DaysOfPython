# Day 42 â€“ HTML Revision & Mini Projects ðŸŽ‰

This directory contains practice projects created on **Day 42** of my #100DaysOfDevOps journey.  
Today was all about revisiting **basic HTML tags** and combining them into small meaningful projects.  

## ðŸ“š Topics Revised
- HTML Boilerplate (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Ordered Lists `<ol>` and Unordered Lists `<ul>` (with nesting)
- `<img>` tag for adding images
- `<a>` anchor tag for adding hyperlinks (including Google Maps)

## ðŸ“š Directory structure
