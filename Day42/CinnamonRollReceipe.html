         <ul>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Granulated sugar</li>
            <li>Quick rise yeast</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Egg + egg yolk</li>
            <li>Bread flour</li>
            <li>Brown sugar</li>

            <li>Salt</li>
         </ul>
         <h2>Instructions:</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Don’t overheat your milk. It should be between 105-115 degrees F. Anything hotter is likely to kill the yeast, which means the cinnamon rolls will not rise.</li>
            <li>A simple tip is to dip your finger in the milk — it should feel warm similar to warm bath water but not HOT. If you warmed it up too much, simply wait a few minutes until it cools down enough to touch.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use room temperature butter for the filling: a lot of recipes call for using melted butter in the filling, but that will cause the filling to leak out before baking. Room temperature butter is best!</li>
            <li>Rub the brown sugar into the butter: after you spread out the softened butter, it’s important to rub the brown sugar into the butter and dough so that it’s well combined. Please refer to the video!</li>
            <li>Use a room temperature egg in the dough: if you use a cold egg, there’s a chance it could affect the yeast or mix with the melted butter and cause it to coagulate. To bring your eggs to room temperature simply place them in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Use bread flour: bread flour is available at most grocery stores and it makes ALL the difference in achieving softer, fluffy, perfect cinnamon rolls. JUST TRUST ME.</li>
            <li>Make sure you flour your work surface and the rolling pin: this is to prevent the cinnamon rolls from sticking to the surface or to the rolling pin.</li>
