<h1>Docker Info</h1>
<p>Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.[5] The service has both free and premium tiers. The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine.[6] It was first released in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc.[7]</p>
<p>Docker is a tool that is used to automate the deployment of applications in lightweight containers so that applications can work efficiently in different environments in isolation.</p>
<p>Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.[8] Because all of the containers share the services of a single operating system kernel, they use fewer resources than virtual machines.</p>
