# Day 41 – HTML Basics Revision

Today was a revision day for HTML fundamentals. I created 3 HTML pages to practice the basics:

## Files

1. **index.html**
   - Practiced different heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`).

2. **paragraph.html**
   - Practiced the paragraph tag (`<p>`) for structuring text.

3. **MovieRankingProject.html**
   - A small project where I created a movie ranking page.
   - Listed my top 3 favorite movies with headings and descriptions.

## Directory Structure

## Learning Outcome
